# Local Line Fronend Dev Challenge

## Challenge

The goal of this exercise is to showcase your frontend skillset by building the requirements below. This repository contains the following:

- A /src/app/page.js that houses the app screen
- An orders.json which contains mock dummy data for Orders
- A package.json with a list of packages to install
- A /components folder where reusable components should be imported from
- A /src/app/globals.css which contains default element styles - please edit them as you see fit

To complete the challenge, please perform the following:

1. Fork the repository to your personal github account.
2. View the Figma design [here]()
3. Create a mapping of the orders so a user could view their orders details. Only spend an hour on it, it's okay if it's not fully finished.
4. Once you've completed the work, push it to your forked repository, and submit a pull request to this repository. Please email us with a link to your pull request once completed.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Creation of React components and reusable patterns
2. Attention to detail from the Figma Design
3. Content generated from orders.json
4. Use of Tailwind CSS (optional)
